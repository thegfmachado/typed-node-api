# Typed Node API 🛠️📘  

**A simple and robust boilerplate** for building Node.js APIs with validation and auto-generated documentation.  

## 📝 Description  

**Typed Node API** is a study project and a starting point for building APIs using Node.js with Fastify. It features data validation with Zod and auto-generated documentation via Swagger, providing a reliable foundation for starting new API projects.

## 💡 Motivation  

Creating well-structured APIs can be challenging. This project was born from the need to explore modern technologies and best practices, such as strict data validation and automated documentation. Besides being a functional example, **Typed Node API** serves as a boilerplate to save time when developing new APIs.

## 🚀 Features  

- **Basic Routes**:  
  - `GET /users`: Lists all users.  
  - `POST /users`: Create a new user.  
- **Data Validation**: Define and validate input schemas with Zod.  
- **Auto-generated Documentation**: Integrated Swagger for interactive API documentation and testing.
